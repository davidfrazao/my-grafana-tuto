Great question ðŸš€ â€” this is one of the most common confusions when starting with Docker Compose.

---

## ðŸ”¹ `docker-compose up`

* Runs containers **in the foreground** (attached mode).
* You see all logs **directly in your terminal**, combined from every service.
* If you press **`Ctrl + C`**, it will **stop all containers** (since theyâ€™re tied to your terminal session).
* Good for **debugging**, initial setup, or when you want to watch the startup sequence (like Elasticsearch + Kibana logs).

---

## ðŸ”¹ `docker-compose up -d`

* Runs containers **in the background** (detached mode).
* The command returns immediately â†’ your terminal is free.
* Containers keep running in the background, even if you close your shell.
* Logs arenâ€™t shown in real time, but you can check them with:

  ```bash
  docker-compose logs -f
  ```
* Good for **production-like runs**, or when you donâ€™t want your terminal blocked.

## ðŸ”¹ Quick comparison

| Command                | Mode       | Logs visible?   | Stops when you exit terminal? |
| ---------------------- | ---------- | --------------- | ----------------------------- |
| `docker-compose up`    | Foreground | Yes (live)      | Yes (Ctrl+C stops containers) |
| `docker-compose up -d` | Detached   | No (use `logs`) | No (keeps running)            |

âœ… **Tip for your Elasticsearch cluster**:

* Use `docker-compose up` the **first time**, so you can watch the certs, passwords, and cluster bootstrap process.
* Once itâ€™s stable, restart it with `docker-compose up -d` so it runs quietly in the background.
