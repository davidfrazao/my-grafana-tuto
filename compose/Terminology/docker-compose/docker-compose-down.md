When you run:

```bash
docker-compose down -v
```

it means:

* **`down`** → stops and removes containers + default network created by `docker-compose up`
* **`-v` / `--volumes`** → also removes *named and anonymous volumes* declared in the `docker-compose.yml`

👉 So this command will **wipe containers, networks, and volumes** (⚠️ data stored in volumes like databases will be lost).

Equivalent long form:

```bash
docker-compose down --volumes
```

Do you want me to also show the difference between:

* `down`
* `down -v`
* `down --rmi all`

Good one 👍

When you run:

```bash
docker-compose down --rmi all
```

it does the following:

* **`down`** → stops containers and removes them, plus removes the default network created by `docker-compose up`.
* **`--rmi all`** → additionally removes **all images** used by the services in your `docker-compose.yml` (both built and pulled).

⚠️ That means next time you run `docker-compose up`, Docker will **have to re-pull or rebuild** all the images, which can take a while.

### Variations:

* `docker-compose down`
  → remove **containers + network**, keep volumes and images.

* `docker-compose down -v`
  → remove **containers + network + volumes**, but keep images.

* `docker-compose down --rmi all`
  → remove **containers + network + images**, but keep volumes.

* `docker-compose down -v --rmi all`
  → remove **everything** (containers, networks, volumes, images).
