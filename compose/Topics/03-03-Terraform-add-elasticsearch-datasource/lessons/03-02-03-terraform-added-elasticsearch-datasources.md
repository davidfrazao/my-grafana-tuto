### ðŸ§© Environment Setup & Verification Checklist

* [ ] copy resources and  delete datasources if needed ( contain datasource configuration )
* [ ] Start the stack using **Docker Compose** from the **VS Code Docker Extension**.
* [ ] Check the docker-compose.03.03.yaml
* [ ] Check the **Terraform** service â€” is running.
* [ ] Access the **Terraform** service â€” view logs - Vscode extention Vscode.
* [ ] Attach shell to **Terraform** service and do "curl -fsS http://grafana:3000/api/health && echo" to check Grafana
* [ ] Create a Elasticsearch datasource by code with Terraform.
  * [] 
  * [ ] On Grafana add manually the dashboad : Dashboard -> choose location -> click ( New ) -> import -> add ID -> Select a Prometheus data source.
  * [ ] From the new dashboard: Edit -> Setting -> JSON Model -> copy the content to ./compose/data/terraform/provisioning/dashboards/Group_01/elastic.json
  * [ ] Attach shell to **Terraform** service 

        ```
        terraform plan                 # preview changes
        terraform apply                # apply (interactive approval)
        ```
  * [ ] check dashboard -> [Grafana](http://127.0.0.1:3000)
