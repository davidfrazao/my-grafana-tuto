Would you like me to format this as a **README section** (with brief explanations under each step)?


### Prometheus container

We add the Prometheus service into the docker compose file: 
- Image: quay.io/prometheus/prometheus:*
- Data location: Docker shared directory
- Configuration file: ./compose/data/prometheus/etc/prometheus.yml

---
### Grafana container

We add the Grafana service into the docker compose file: 
- Image: grafana/grafana:*
- data location: Docker shared directory
- Configuration file: ./compose/data/grafana/etc/provisioning/datasources/datasource.yaml
-

### Test communication btw prometheus to grafana

attach shell to Pronetheus 

```FROM PROMETHEUS
wget -qO- http://grafana:3000
```
