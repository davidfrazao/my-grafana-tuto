## Resources 


This project follows a **cumulative configuration approach**.
Each lesson progressively extends the configuration introduced in previous lessons, adding new components, parameters, or integration scenarios.

To simplify setup, you can use the following script to apply the configuration files associated with the current lesson:

```bash
./resources/script-copy-to.sh
```

This script automatically copies the relevant configuration files to your working environment, ensuring consistency and reducing manual setup effort.

Would you like me to add a short note about how the script works (e.g., which directories it copies from/to)?
