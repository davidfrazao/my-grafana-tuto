| -------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Table**                        | Tabular data visualization with sorting, links, and thresholds.                  |
| **Logs**                         | Displays log lines (typically used with Loki).                                   |

| **Node Graph**                   | Shows relationships (nodes/edges) ‚Äî great for service maps or dependency graphs. |
| **State timeline**               | Visualizes state changes over time (e.g., status transitions).                   |
| **Annotations / Event timeline** | Timeline of events or alerts.                                                    |
| **Text**                         | Rich text (Markdown/HTML) content ‚Äî for notes, titles, or custom dashboards.     |

Would you like me to give you the **exact JSON names** of these panel types (as used in Grafana dashboard JSON files)?
That‚Äôs useful if you‚Äôre generating dashboards programmatically (e.g., via Terraform, Grafonnet, or provisioning).
