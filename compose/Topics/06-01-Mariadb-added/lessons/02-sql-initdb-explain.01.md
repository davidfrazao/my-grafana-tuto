Perfect, letâ€™s break that down line by line ðŸš€

# explanation of the sql scripte executed at the firts exection.

The sql script is located : ${PWD}/compose/data/mariadb/initdb/01_create_exporter.sh:

```bash
mariadb -uroot -p"$MARIADB_ROOT_PASSWORD" -e \
  "SELECT user,host,plugin FROM mysql.user WHERE user='exporter'; SHOW GRANTS FOR 'exporter'@'%';"
```

---

### 1. `mariadb -uroot -p"$MARIADB_ROOT_PASSWORD"`

* Runs the MariaDB client (`mariadb`).
* `-u root` â†’ log in as **root user**.
* `-p"$MARIADB_ROOT_PASSWORD"` â†’ use the root password stored in the environment variable `MARIADB_ROOT_PASSWORD`.

---

### 2. `-e " ... "`

* `-e` means *execute the following SQL commands directly from the command line* instead of opening an interactive shell.
* The SQL commands are inside the quotes.

---

### 3. First SQL command:

```sql
SELECT user, host, plugin FROM mysql.user WHERE user='exporter';
```

* Queries the **mysql.user** table (where accounts are stored).
* Shows:

  * `user` â†’ username (`exporter`)
  * `host` â†’ which hosts the account is valid from (`%` in your case, meaning any host)
  * `plugin` â†’ the authentication plugin being used (e.g., `mysql_native_password`, `caching_sha2_password`, etc.)

ðŸ‘‰ This checks **how the `exporter` user is defined**.

---

### 4. Second SQL command:

```sql
SHOW GRANTS FOR 'exporter'@'%';
```

* Displays all the **privileges** assigned to the user `exporter` connecting from any host (`%`).
* Example output might look like:

  ```
  GRANT PROCESS, REPLICATION CLIENT, SELECT ON *.* TO 'exporter'@'%'
  GRANT SELECT ON `performance_schema`.* TO 'exporter'@'%'
  ```

ðŸ‘‰ This checks **what permissions the `exporter` user has**.

---

âœ… **Summary:**
This whole command logs in as root and verifies:

1. That the `exporter` user exists, where it can connect from, and what authentication method it uses.
2. That the `exporter` user has the correct grants (read-only + monitoring).

Would you like me to also show you an **expected example output** so you can compare against your setup?
