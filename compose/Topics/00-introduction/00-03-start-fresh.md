### Refresh Start

To refresh this project, follow these steps:

1. **What to clean:**
   Delete files and subdirectories under `./compose/data/*`.

2. **Scope:**
   Not all subdirectories need to be cleaned â€” only those specified.

3. **How to run:**
   Execute the script:

   ```bash
   ./script/cleanup_persistent_data_from_local_disk.sh
   ```

4. **Backup:**
   The script automatically creates a backup copy of all deleted files and directories before cleanup.
